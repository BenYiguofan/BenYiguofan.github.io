  Around &nbsp; me, <br> I noticed <br> a very different <br> <strong>Tehran</strong> from the one I’d been used to. <br> An influx of new, shamelessly luxurious condos had replaced the charming little houses I was familiar with. <br> New roads, new highways, hordes of invasive SUVs. <br> Large billboards with advertisements for Swiss-made watches and Korean flat screen TVs. <br> Women in colorful scarves and manteaus, men with dyed hair and beards, and hundreds of charming cafes with hip western music and female staff. <br> <em>They were the kinds of changes that creep up on people; the kind you only really notice once normal life gets taken away from you.</em>
  <br> Two weeks later, I began writing again. <br> Some friends agreed to let me start a blog as part of their arts magazine. I called it Ketabkhan — <strong>it means book-reader in Persian.</strong>
