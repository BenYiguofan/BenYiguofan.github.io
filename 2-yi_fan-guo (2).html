  Around &nbsp; me, I &nbsp; noticed &nbsp; a &nbsp; very &nbsp; different &nbsp; <strong>Tehran</strong> &nbsp; from &nbsp; the &nbsp; one &nbsp; I’d &nbsp; been &nbsp; used &nbsp; to. <br> <em>An influx of new, shamelessly &nbsp; luxurious &nbsp; condos &nbsp; had replaced the charming little houses I was familiar with.</em> <br> <strong>New &nbsp; roads, &nbsp; new &nbsp; highways, &nbsp; hordes &nbsp; of &nbsp; invasive &nbsp; SUVs.</strong> <br> <em>Large billboards with advertisements for Swiss-made watches and Korean flat screen TVs.</em> <br> <em>Women in colorful scarves and manteaus, men with dyed hair and beards, and hundreds of charming cafes with hip western music and female staff.</em> <br> <em>They were the kinds of changes that creep up on people; the kind you only really notice once normal life gets taken away from you.</em>
  <br> Two weeks later, I began writing again. <br> <em>Some friends agreed to let me start a blog as part of their arts magazine.</em> <br> I called it <strong>Ketabkhan</strong> — <em>it means book-reader in Persian.</em>
