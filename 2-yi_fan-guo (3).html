  Around me, I noticed a very different Tehran from the one I’d been used to. <br> An influx of new, shamelessly luxurious condos had replaced the charming little houses I was familiar with. <br> <em>New roads, new highways, hordes of invasive SUVs.</em> <br> Large billboards with advertisements for Swiss-made watches and Korean flat screen TVs. Women in colorful scarves and manteaus, men with dyed hair and beards, and hundreds of charming cafes with hip western music and female staff. They were the kinds of changes that creep up on people; the kind you only really notice once normal life gets taken away from you.
  <strong>Two weeks later,</strong> I began writing again. Some friends agreed to let me start a blog as part of their arts magazine.<br> I &nbsp; called &nbsp; it &nbsp; Ketabkhan — it &nbsp; means &nbsp; book-reader &nbsp; in &nbsp; Persian.
