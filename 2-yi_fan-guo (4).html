  <strong>Around me,</strong> <p>I noticed a very different Tehran from the one I’d been used to.</p> <br> An influx of new, shamelessly luxurious condos had replaced the charming little houses I was familiar with. <br> <p><em>New roads,</p> <p>new highways,</p> <p>hordes of invasive SUVs.</em></p> <br> Large billboards with advertisements for Swiss-made watches and Korean flat screen TVs. <br> <p><strong>Women</strong> in <strong>colorful</strong> scarves <strong>and</strong> manteaus, men with dyed hair and beards, and hundreds of charming cafes with hip western music and female staff.</p> They were the kinds of changes that creep up on people; the kind you only really notice once normal life gets taken away from you.
  <strong>Two weeks later,</strong> I began writing again. <br> <p>Some friends agreed to let me start a blog as part of their arts magazine.</p> <p><strong>I</strong> &nbsp; called &nbsp; <strong>it</strong> &nbsp; Ketabkhan — <strong>it</strong> &nbsp; means &nbsp; <strong>book-reader</strong> &nbsp; in &nbsp; <strong>Persian.</strong></p>
