  <h1 class="hurricane" > Around me, </h1> <h2 class="hurricane" > I noticed a very different Tehran from the one I’d been used to. </h2> <h3 class="hurricane" > An influx of new, </h3> <h4 class="hurricane" > shamelessly luxurious condos had replaced the charming little houses I was familiar with. New roads, </h4> <h5 class="hurricane" > new highways, hordes of invasive SUVs. </h5> <h4 class="hurricane" > Large billboards with advertisements for Swiss-made watches and Korean flat screen TVs. </h4> <h3 class="hurricane" > Women in colorful scarves and manteaus, men with dyed hair and beards, and hundreds of charming cafes with hip western music and female staff. </h3> <h4 class="hurricane" > They were the kinds of changes that creep up on people; the kind you only really notice once normal life gets taken away from you. </h4>
  <h3 class="hurricane" > Two weeks later, I began writing again. </h3>  <h2 class="hurricane" > Some friends agreed to let me start a blog as part of their arts magazine. </h2> <strong>I called it Ketabkhan — it means book-reader in Persian.</strong>
