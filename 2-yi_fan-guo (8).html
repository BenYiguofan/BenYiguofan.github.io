   <p>Around &nbsp; me,</p>  <p>I noticed a very <strong>different Tehran</strong> from the one I’d been used to.</p> <p>An influx of new, shamelessly luxurious condos had replaced the charming little houses I was familiar with.</p> <p><em>New roads, new highways, hordes of invasive SUVs.</em></p>
   <p>Large billboards with advertisements for Swiss-made watches and Korean flat screen TVs.</p> <p>Women in colorful scarves and manteaus, men with dyed hair and beards, and hundreds of charming cafes with hip western music and female staff.</p>
   <p>They were the kinds of changes that creep up on people; the kind you only really notice once normal life gets taken away from you.</p>
   <p>Two weeks later, I began writing again. Some friends agreed to let me start a blog as part of their arts magazine.</p> <p class="hurricane" > I &nbsp; called &nbsp; it &nbsp; Ketabkhan — it &nbsp; means &nbsp; book-reader &nbsp; in &nbsp; Persian. </p>
