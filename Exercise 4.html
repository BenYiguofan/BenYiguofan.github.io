  <div class="happy">
  <h3>Around me, I noticed a very different Tehran from the one I’d been used to.</h3>
  <div>

  <div class="a">DYNAMIC </div>


  <div>
  <h3> An influx of new, shamelessly luxurious condos had replaced the charming little houses I was familiar with.</h3>
  </div>


  <div class="a">DREAMY </div>


  <div>
  <h3>New roads, new highways, hordes of invasive SUVs.
      Large billboards with advertisements for Swiss-made watches and Korean flat screen TVs.
      Women in colorful scarves and manteaus, men with dyed hair and beards, and hundreds of charming cafes with hip western music and female staff.</h3>
  <div>

  <div class="a">Dreary </div>

  <h3>They were the kinds of changes that creep up on people; the kind you only really notice once normal life gets taken away from you.</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="a">DISOBEDIENT </div>
