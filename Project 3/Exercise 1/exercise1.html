Reading response: <br>
In this video, there are two favorite sentences. “Privacy is the value of the 21st century and it’s not outdated” and “Fight for you self-determination in the digital age”. Nowadays, many people lose their security and privacy because many phone companies and the government organization watch their personal information and they actually don’t know, especially, in China.
As far as I am concerned. I am so angry that my country always use those disgusting ways to “look at me”. It is not fair. It hurt me a lot. When I think about the data retention in China, It make me even more angry. In China, you can’t see any important information because the government make them as a secret. They will never let you know because you have no right to do with it. You can’t ask for researching the data retention about you own information. It is illegal. The government wants to try to avoid and never ever open to the public. However, my life should be happiness, but I live in the devil’s hands. When I talk to someone on the Wechat, the compony will keep those information for a few years. Although you delete your information on the phone, they still can see. At the same time, I lose my self-determination. I can’t make my own decision to search my personal information in the data retention.
I always have an opinion. Everybody can stand up and start to against the governments. Let them know that our privacy is significant and we have right to see everything back of data retention. We need freedom not fear.

Proposal1: <br>
The type of design can be little animation with the some geometric shape. Using the map (China) to show how the company track us data. On the map, I will pick up some huge cities which has high population, such as Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Hangzhou.  The color of map is base on the color of flag. So it can be red. Meanwhile, there are many small dots (or I can use simple thing, such as phone, human head, eyeballs, they looks like icon) on the maps. The shape of dot is circle. The color I want to choose  is white. Each dot as a user information. Then, using the many lines to connect with each other. It looks like network. Under the map, there is a data (user) information. When you click the dots on the maps, it can show you some things about what’s some things he send or pose today.

  <div class="Proposal2">
Proposal2: <br>
This proposal is looks like a two page web design. On the web, the first thing you can see he construction of space can be a key lock. Besides the key lock, there is a user name. When you use key open the lock. There is a small block. In the block, there are some user’s information, such as location, time ) However, I want to make a specific diagram. Each thing can connect to the next. The block is tell you some basic things. But the diagram can make more details. For example, when you click the time in the block. Then there is a diagrams under the block. It can show some things he did during this time.
